========================================
Colaboration With Other Rebuild Projects
========================================

(this is a very rough draft

Brainstorming:
##############

How we can help other rebuild projects
--------------------------------------

 * Share infrastructure

   * upstream source mirror?
   * cross site backup?
   * mirror each other's stuff

 * QA help

   * infrastructure (installing QA systems/tools)
   * building QA test suite
   * Shared test suite
   * Cross-QA checks
     * ABI testing verification

 * Documentation

   * pool documentation (write it for multiple distros)

 * Build related information

   * build order
   * package metadata
   * package content signatures
   * ABI compliance information

Why another rebuild project?
----------------------------

 * How we benefit

   * process  and code
   * community
   * Forkability test (can you fork the project if we all walk away?)

 * how they benefit
   * community
   * meetings, structure
   * updates
   * EL rebuild planet?

Current draft:

(introduction of some sort) "we work on a project similar to this one... blah blah blah

We are excited to work together with others in the EL rebuild space feel that there is plenty of room for separate but collaborative communities in this environment.  The similarities in our goals should work for our mutual benefit. And the differences which exist should only strengthen us all.

Where can we collaborate?

There are many places where EL rebuild projects can easily collaborate. The first that comes to mind is in the documentation side. The fact that all of these distros share a common ancestor should lead to very similar processes.

There is a great need for documentation and how-to's. Sadly most documentation is woefully out of date. This is one place where the colaboration between the rebuild projects could be
